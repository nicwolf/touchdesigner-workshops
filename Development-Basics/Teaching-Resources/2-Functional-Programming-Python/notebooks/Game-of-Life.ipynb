    "We've been writing code in somewhat of a 'functional' style --- that is we've been writing separate functions that each accomplish one particular task and are isolated from each other. This is a perfectly valid way of writing code, and has pros and cons just like any other style of progoramming. What we'll explore next is a style of programming called Object Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is a programming paradigm that gives us the ability to think about and structure our code as a real-world object. So instead of passing arrays between functions, we'll create a 'Game of Life board' object with persistent data and we'll use that for our simulation (BAD). This style of programming also has pros and cons. We won't get into those here, I think that the best way to learn about which programming paradigm you should choose to use for a given task is through experience. "
