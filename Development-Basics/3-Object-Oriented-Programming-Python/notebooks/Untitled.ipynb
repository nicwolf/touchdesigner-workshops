    "In the last lesson, we wrote code in a 'functional' style. It's called the 'functional' style of programming because we wrote separate, isolated functions and chained them together to accomplish our goal. This is a perfectly valid way of writing code, and has pros and cons just like any other style of programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we'll explore next is a style of programming called Object Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is a programming paradigm that gives us the ability to think more abstractly and structure our code as if it were a real-world object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of passing an array that represents a Game of Life board between functions, we'll create a Game of Life 'object' that 'owns' a simulation board and can do things with it. The difference may not be super clear right now but it will hopefully come more into focus when we start to write some code. \n",
    "\n",
    "This style of programming also has pros and cons which we won't get into those here. People spend years and years getting familiar with different programming paradigms, and I think that the best way to learn about them is through experience. Don't sweat it too much now --- try writing code, and try writing code different ways. You'll figure out what works and what doesn't."
