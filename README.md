# Touchdesigner-Workshops

## Development Basics
In this workshop we cover software development fundamentals, implementing the Conway's cellular automata, the Game of Life. By the end of this workshop you will have:

  * Gained some experience using `git`
  * Set up a Python environment with Conda that TouchDesigner can use.
  * Learned to use Jupyter Notebooks to quickly prototype code in Python.
  * Written code to implement Conway's Game of Life a number of different ways:
      1. Python (functional paradigm)
      2. Python (object-oriented paradigm)
      3. TouchDesigner CHOPs
      4. GLSL Shaders
  * Evaluated the pros and cons of each of these approaches.
  * Generated automatic documentation for your code with Sphinx (Maybe?)

We will also cover good software design principles and methods --- you will learn how to write robust, well-documented, and easy-to-read code.
